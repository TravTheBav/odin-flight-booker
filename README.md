This is a barebones Rails application that let's a user book a flight from a very limited database of fake flights. The user can search, pick, and book flights with up to 4 passengers. This app does not look too pretty or have many features but has been suprisingly challenging to take on. While all of the building blocks from previous lessons were there for me to use, wrapping my mind around how to model all the classes and relationships between them was very difficult to comprehend at first. After a lot of tinkering, reading, and perserverence I finally managed to find a suitable way to setup the model relationships which allowed me to use Rails nested forms with ease.
