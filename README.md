In this project I am using Rails to create a basic flight booker. The user is prompted to input all necessary information, such as which airports they are flying to and from, which airline they want to fly with, flight dates, and billing information (all options for the user to select from are just sample data).

This project is from The Odin Project - Ruby on Rails course: https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-on-rails-flight-booker
